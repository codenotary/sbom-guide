# Increasing the Security of Software

## Definitions

**Notarization** or **Signing** is the process of creating a cryptographic signature of a software asset and, optionally, storing it in a cryptographically-verifiable immutable ledger. The signature can then be used to verify the integrity of the asset and authenticate its chain of custody.

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the integrity of a software asset by comparing its unique hash with a hash signed by a known trusted signer identity. Authentication is critical for tracking the provenance of software assets and ensuring that they have not been tampered with.
