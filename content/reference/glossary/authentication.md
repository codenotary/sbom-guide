    The process of comparing a software asset to a trusted, verifiable record of that asset and its composition to ensure that the asset hasn't been modified or tampered with since creation.

    In the context of SBOMs, this means checking a software asset against an immutable, cryptographically-verifiable record of that asset and its componentsâ€”by comparing each component with its recorded hash, ensuring that none of the components comprising the asset are considered untrusted, and checking the validity of the cryptographic signature on the SBOM.
