    A list of files, dependencies, and other information about a software project. Examples include:

    * `package.json` in Node projects and `pyproject.toml` in Python projects are examples of package manifests, which define a project's dependencies and other metadata.
    * Docker's [Image Manifests](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/) reference image layers for multiple variants of a container image, allowing for a single image to be used for multiple architectures and operating systems.
    * SPDX and CycloneDX are standards for sharing the metadata of software artifacts between different projects, allowing developers to track the licensing and provenance of their dependencies.
